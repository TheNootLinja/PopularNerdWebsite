## Tech Stack

    1. Svelte

## Things that still need work

    1. Need to make github and email be clickable links instead of just text.
    2. Need to get project files together and hosted to link to them inside of the projects section.

## Changes to projects section

    When viewing the site on a mobile device, I think how we currently have it set up is good but could use some small tweaks when scaling up to bigger screens. I want to find the breakpoint when the project tile starts to look a little bit stretched, and change the layout of projects to be a project tile on the left, then a short description on the right, then flip flopped for each subsequent row. This will give a cool look to the page on larger screens and help us show off the projects better.
