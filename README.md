## Goals for this site

    1. Initial Launch
        1. The biggest goal for this site is to have a MVP up by the end of 2020 which givesme about 2 months
        to work on it in my spare time This first launch doesn't need to be absolutely perfect as I am trying
        to hold myself to getting something done that is good but can still be worked on as my web development
        skills progress.
        2. The second biggest goal of the site has to do with the content. The site would ideally feature 6
        projects I am proud to showcase that show that I know what I am doing and also show that while I may not
         be the best web developer rigth away, I am quickly learning and always looking to improve my craft.
         It may not be doable to have 6 WOW worthy applications done by the end of the year, but I think I can
         get at least 3 done and ready to be hosted/shown in my portfolio which will give me a strong start.
            1. React Movies Project
            2. Popular Nerd Website built in Svelte
            3. Monster Rolodex - Built in React - https://gifted-shirley-d8a43d.netlify.app/
        1. This is the last part that has to do with the initial launch but also is very important. I need to
        sit down after getting the site layout how I like it and decide on a color scheme to apply to everything.
        I already have a few colors picked out but will need to make sure what I put together is cohesive and eye
        atching.

## Current TODO list for site

    [] Make changes to header to make hamburger/mobile menu clickable to display dropdown.
    [] Compile a list of other related interests that I could put into the about me description.
    [] Get some good photos of myself for including in the about me.
        [] Coffee
        [] Picture of me at desk working
